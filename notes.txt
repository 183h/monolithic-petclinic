TODOs für den Code für master Branch
------------------------------------

* Tests für Management Controller.

* Rename GitHub project to monolothic-pet…
  * Rename Maven group usw. Maybe rename packages?
  * Gregor: ok. have to agree on package name. i suggest: monolithic.petclinic
* Write descriptive Readme
* add us to license holders

* @DataJpaTest vs wie alles + datenbank am besten? ClinicServiceTests

* Remove Warning
    [WARNING] Less warnings are:
    [WARNING] 10:1 Cannot link source map. Css result location is not know and could not be deduced from input less source..
    https://github.com/wro4j/wro4j/issues/517
    wasted 2hours trying to remove this warning

    we can only get rid of it, if we remove less. but it would make a ui restyling harder.
    so we should first restyle the ui, then remove less. will do that soon
